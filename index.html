      <h3>Dessert</h3>
      <p>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Colorings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures.</p>
